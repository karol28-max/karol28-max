👋 Hi there! I'm Karol Lopez

I’m a Data Analyst with a strong foundation in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. Proficient in Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau, I enjoy turning raw data into clear insights that support better business decisions.  

Alongside my analytics background, I work as a Virtual Assistant in the immigration law field, where I manage cases, organize workflows, and strengthen problem-solving skills—bringing a unique perspective to my analytical work.  

I’m detail-oriented, adaptable, and focused on building strong relationships. I thrive under pressure, stay organized in fast-paced environments, and approach challenges creatively. I’m excited to apply my data skills to meaningful projects and collaborate with teams to make an impact.
